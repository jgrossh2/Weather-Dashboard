#Weather-Dashboard
# Description

Weather Dashboard was created in order to search for a specific city to view the current weather. Temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV Index are given for the current date. There is a 5 day forecast given for the searched city which includes temperature and humidity for those days. The city that is searched is then saved, and can be revisited to find the weather information needed.
